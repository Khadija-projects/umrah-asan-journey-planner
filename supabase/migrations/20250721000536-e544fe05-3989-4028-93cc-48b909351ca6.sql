    <li><strong>Mina & Arafat:</strong> Sites central to Hajj rituals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Modern Comforts for Pilgrims</h2>

  'Holy Madina: The City of Peace and Prophet''s Love',

  '<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Holy Madina â€” Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah â€” is the second holiest city in Islam and the final resting place of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). For every Muslim, a visit to Madina brings a sense of calmness, love, and connection to the Prophet''s (PBUH) legacy.</p>

  <h2>Masjid an-Nabawi</h2>
  <p>Masjid an-Nabawi (The Prophet''s Mosque) is the highlight of every visit to Madina. Praying here once is better than a thousand prayers elsewhere â€” except Masjid al-Haram. Pilgrims offer Salat, send blessings upon the Prophet (PBUH), and visit Rawdah â€” a garden from the gardens of Paradise.</p>

  <h2>Key Ziaraat in Madina</h2>
  <p>Madina is full of blessed historical sites:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Jannat al-Baqi:</strong> The resting place of many family members and companions of the Prophet (PBUH).</li>
    <li><strong>Quba Mosque:</strong> The first mosque built in Islam. Praying two rakats here equals the reward of an Umrah.</li>
    <li><strong>Uhud Mountain:</strong> Site of the famous Battle of Uhud. Visit the graves of the martyrs and reflect on their sacrifice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tranquil Atmosphere</h2>
  <p>Unlike the bustling energy of Makkah, Madina''s vibe is peaceful and calm. Streets are quiet, people walk slowly, and the whole city radiates serenity.</p>

  <h2>Tips for a Smooth Visit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dress respectfully and maintain the sanctity of this blessed city.</li>
    <li>Use taxis or local buses to reach ziaraat spots easily.</li>
    <li>Book hotels near the Prophet''s Mosque for convenience and frequent prayers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Holy Madina is not just a city â€” it is an embrace of peace and mercy. May every visitor return with hearts full of light, love, and blessings.</p>
  
  <p><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Want to experience the serenity of Madina? Umrah Asan helps you find trusted hotels and smooth taxi rides for your peaceful stay.</strong></p>',
